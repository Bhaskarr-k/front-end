### Array length:
- the length property returns the lenght size of the array.
### Array to string:
- the java script method **tostring** converts an array to a string of array values.
- it remove the double quotes.
### Array at:
- in array at method we can give index value then it give output array item.
### Array join:
- thr **join** method also joins all arrays elements into a string.
- in paranthesis we can give according to our needs
- it behaves like a **tosting** but in addition you can specify the seperator
### pop():
- the pop() method removes the last element from an array.
- if we are mention index value in paranthesis then it will delete based on index position.
### push():
- the **push** method adds a new element to an array at the end.
### shift:
- the **shift** method removes the first array element and shifts all other elementd to a lower index.
### unshift:
- the **unshift** method adds a new element to an array at begining.
### Array length:
- the **length** property provides an easy way to append a new element to an array.
### Array concat():
- the **concat** method creates a new array by merging existing array.
### copywithin():
- the **copywithin** method copies array elements to another positio in an array.
### Array flat:
- the **flat** method creates a new array with sub-array elements concatinated to a specified depth.
- suppose we are taking nested array then it will rgive output in order wise.
### flatmap():
- the **flatmap** mehtod first maps all elements of an array and then creates a new array by flattening the array.
### Array splice():
- the **splice** method can be use to add new items to an array.
### splice() to remove elements:
- with clever parameter setting you can **splice** to remove elements without leaving holes in the array
- example fruit.splice(0,1)
- 0 indicates index number and 1 indicates how many elements removed.
### slice():
the **slice** method slices out a piece of an array into a new array.
- in existing array we can modify using slice method.
- suppose we have "apple","banana"
- now we need to put first as a banana then we are using slice method.
