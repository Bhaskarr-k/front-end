# variables in Javascript?
- A Variable is a container for a value like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence

 - variables are nothing but a storage container helps us to store some data in it.
 - storage advantage is **reuse and modify**

 ## rules for variable names:
 - using all upper case letters are recommended.
 - using special charecters are not recommended.
 - using numbers are not recommended.
 - using space in between words.

 # in java script mainly we listen one word that is **camel** it means every letter start with capital letter(upper case)


 ### variables created in three ways in java script

 -   var
 -   let
 -   const

 ### initilizaing a variable
 -  once you have declared a variable you can initiliaze it within a value.
 - you do this by typing the variable name folowe by an equals sign **(=)**

 ### var
 - (declaration)first we need to create container
 - initilization(we need to give value of container)
 - re initilization(if we want to modify then we can use this)
 - re-declaration(if we want to re create a container then we can use this)

 -   Ex:
    var username;

-  username='basu';
-  username='bhaskar';


### let
- declaration(frist we want to create a container)
- initilization(afetr that give value of the container)
- re initilization(if we want to modify value then we can use this)

- Ex:  let username;
-      username='basu';
-   username='bhaskar';


### const

- in const we can declare container and value same line.
