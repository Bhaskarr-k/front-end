# operators in javascript?
- operator is nothing but a operand that means **symbol**.
- operators are nothing but parameters help us to perform operations on the data which have stored a value.
- javascript operators are used to perform diffrent types of mathmatical and logical computations.
- there are difrent types of operators in javascript they are in given below.
- Arthamtic operaors

  Assignment operators 

  comparision operators

  string operators

  logical opertors

  bitwise operators

  ternary operators

  type operators
## Arithmetic operators:
- Arthimetic operators are use to perform arithmetic on numbers.
- example   + addition
    
            - substraction

            * multiplication

            ** exponential

            / Divison

            % modulas

            ++ increment

            -- Decrement

## Assignment operators:
- Assignment operators assign values to javascript variables.
- the Addition Assignment opearator adds a value to a variable.

- |operator  | example  | same as |
  |-----------|----------|--------|
  | =        |  x+y      | x=y    |
  | +=       |  x+=y     | x=x+y  |
  | -=       |  x-=y     | x=x-y  |
  | *=       |  x*=y     | x=x*y  |
  | /=       |  x/=y     | x=x/y  |
  | **==     |  x**=y    | x=x**y |

## comparision operators:
- comparision opearotrs are used in logical statement to determinw equality or diffrence between variables or values.
- x=5

 |operator      |   description      |comparing  |    returns|
  |--------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
  |==	         |equal to	          |x == 5     |	  true    |
  | ===          | rqual value and equal type  | x===5  | true|
  | !=           | not equal          | x!=5      | true      |
  | !===       | not equal value or not equal type | x!==8 | true|
  | >            | greater then       |  x>8       |   true  |
  | <            | lessthan           |  x<8       |   true  |
  | >=           | greater then equal to | x>=8    | false|
  | <=           | lessthan equal to   | x<=8      |  true  |


  ## logical operaors:
  - logical operators are use to determine the logic between variables or values.
  - given that **x=6** and **y=3** the table below explains the logical operators.
