# operators in javascript?
- operator is nothing but a operand that means **symbol**.
- operators are nothing but parameters help us to perform operations on the data which have stored a value.
- javascript operators are used to perform diffrent types of mathmatical and logical computations.
- there are difrent types of operators in javascript they are in given below.
-     Arthamtic operators

      Assignment operators 

      comparision operators

      string operators

      logical opertors

      bitwise operators

      ternary operators

      type operators

## Arithmetic operators:
- Arthimetic operators are use to perform arithmetic on numbers.
- example    
-           + addition
    
            - substraction

            * multiplication

            ** exponential

            / Divison

            % modulas

            ++ increment

            -- Decrement

## Assignment operators:
- Assignment operators assign values to javascript variables.
- the Addition Assignment opearator adds a value to a variable.

- |operator  | example  | same as |
  |-----------|----------|--------|
  | =        |  x+y      | x=y    |
  | +=       |  x+=y     | x=x+y  |
  | -=       |  x-=y     | x=x-y  |
  | *=       |  x*=y     | x=x*y  |
  | /=       |  x/=y     | x=x/y  |
  | **==     |  x**=y    | x=x**y |

## comparision operators:
- comparision opearotrs are used in logical statement to determinw equality or diffrence between variables or values.
- x=5

 |operator      |   description      |comparing  |    returns|
  |--------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
  |==	         |equal to	          |x == 5     |	  true    |
  | ===          | rqual value and equal type  | x===5  | true|
  | !=           | not equal          | x!=5      | true      |
  | !===       | not equal value or not equal type | x!==8 | true|
  | >            | greater then       |  x>8       |   true  |
  | <            | lessthan           |  x<8       |   true  |
  | >=           | greater then equal to | x>=8    | false|
  | <=           | lessthan equal to   | x<=8      |  true  |


  ## string operators:
  - all the comparision operators avove can also be used on strings:
  - note that strings are compared alphabetically.
  ## javascript addition function:
  - the **+** can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:
  - the **+=** assignment operator can also be used to add concatenate strings.
  ## javascript logical operators:
  - comparision operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or diffrence between the values.
  - && returns true if both operands are true.
  - || returns true if atleast one operand is true.
  - ! negates the boolean value.
  ## Bitwise operators:
  - **Bitwise AND**: Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones.
  - **Bitwise OR**: Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros.
  - **bitwise not**: Inverts the bits of its operand.

  ## logical operators:
  - **Logical AND(&&)**: Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.
  - **Logical OR(||)**: Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, || returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.
  - **Logical NOT**: Returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.
