# what is Responsive web design?
- responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
- responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
- Responsive web design is not a program or a javascript.
# Media Queries:
- Media queries allow us to run a series of tests (for example, whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width or resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
- For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 80rem wide. The CSS for the .container selector will only be applied if these two things are true.

# Responsive layout Technologies?

### flexbox:
- n flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items according to the space in their container. 
- By changing the values for flex-grow and flex-shrink you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.

### Grid:

- n CSS grid layout the fr unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks.
- The next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at 1fr. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container.
